      "(\"Answer the question as truthfully as possible using the provided context, and if the answer is not contained within the text below, say I could not find an answer to your question, please reach out to Helpdesk.\\n* \\n\\nContext:\\niClickers are a personal response system that can be used for a variety of purposes in the classroom. They use a wireless receiver to record student votes, and software on the instructor's laptop records and displays the votes. Students can receive points for participation and correctness of their responses. Grading information can be exported and uploaded into Sakai. Faculty can check out iClickers from CIS for the semester or a single class. CIS also provides training and software installation and configuration. ARCS can provide consultations on incorporating iClickers into syllabi. For more information, visit the iClickers website. Faculty, students and staff at HMC can check out sets of 50 iClickers from the CIS Help Desk, as well as the wireless base stations. For large lecture classes, students may be asked to rent or purchase their own iClickers from Huntley Bookstore, in which case faculty can just check out the wireless base stations they need. CIS will usually send an email to the faculty several weeks before classes start to inquire if they want to use the iClickers in a class. Faculty can also send email to the CIS Help Desk at helpdesk@hmc.edu if they are interested in trying out the iClickers in a class. Itâ€™s helpful if faculty can give us the following information when requesting the iClickers and/or wireless base stations: Course name and number When does class meet? Where does class meet? How many students are in the class?\\n\\nQ: How many iClickers are there?\", 'https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/iclickers/')\n"
