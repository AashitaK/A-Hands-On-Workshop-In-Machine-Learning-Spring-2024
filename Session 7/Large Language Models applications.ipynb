    "### Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI models such as GPT-4 and other similar models use decoder-only transformer model architecture. They are trained on a large corpus and are rumored to have trillions of parameters. Many of these models are closed sourced but have been made available via APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models) is a great place to find open source models. You can use models hosted on their platforms using their [huggingface python library](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/index).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/guides/quickstart) is a great place to host your demo machine learning projects/apps for free.\n",

    "Prompt engineering can be especially useful while using LLMs for building apps. For example, Open AI (the company that released GPT models) has shared some [strategies and tactics](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) to make the most out of their LLM models.\n",
