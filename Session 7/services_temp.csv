Academic Advisory System,"The academic advisory system is used to send emails to students regarding concerns or encouraging notes. These advisories are automatically copied to the instructor, student's advisors, and the Office of Academic Affairs. The Academic Affairs Committee keeps track of all advisories and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will meet with students who receive two or more advisories. Advisories can be used for concerns such as missing assignments or poor performance, but they can also be used to send positive notes about improvements or good exam performance. The advisory system can also be used to schedule conferences with students. Available to faculty and emeritus at HMC. The Academic Advisory System can be accessed by logging into the HMC Portal and looking in the Faculty tab.
Selecting a course takes you to a class list from which you can select one or more students. The next step allows you to enter any additional personalized comments and/or request a conference with the student(s). Finally, you’ll be able to preview the notices before they are sent.",https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/academic-advisory-system/

Course Mailing Lists,"CIS provides several different methods for emailing the instructors and students in a particular course. One option is using Google Groups. Another option is through the HMC portal, which allows faculty members to email all of the students in their class. Sakai also has an Email Archive tool that can create a mailing list. Available to faculty and emeritus at HMC. You can see all of the course mailing lists that you are a member of by going to Google Groups and clicking the My Groups link. Google Groups has a web interface to your course mailing lists which makes it easy to add and remove members and view archived messages. Any email client may be used to send mail to a Google Group.  If you are a faculty member teaching a course, then you are the owner of the course list and can make changes to the default settings. The default settings for a course mailing list are:
Only members of the group can see the list of members.
The web archive of messages sent to the group is turned off.
Prospective members must ask the owner of the list to be able to join.
We also have a list of all automatically generated course mailing lists on Google Groups (HMC login is required).
The HMC portal allows you to view all of your students (with photos) and email the class. The portal functions more as a one way faculty to student broadcast system, in that the students cannot mail to the class list via the portal.
The Sakai Email Archive tool allows you to email students and keeps a convenient searchable and sortable archive of the messages on the Sakai site. You can set up an address of your choice for the list, and configure the tool to allow email from any address or keep it closed. You do not have to be in Sakai to send messages, but can use the email client of your choice. Although the Email Archive tool is not part of the default set up for a course site, it is very easy to add, and can easily be configured to suit your needs. Anyone you have included in the site (eg. as an auditor) will be included in the recipient list. Even if you don’t use Sakai for anything else, it is worth considering the Email Archive tool for communicating with your class.",https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/course-mailing-lists/

Hard Drive Encryption,"Hard drive encryption uses cryptographic algorithms to secure data on a hard drive. Data on an encrypted hard drive cannot be read by anyone who does not have access to the system, appropriate key, or password. Encryption is best used on machines that can easily be lost or stolen. At HMC, CIS recommends encrypting your entire operating system volume through BitLocker for Windows computers, or FileVault for Apple computers. You will be given a unique recovery key during the encryption setup process. This key is needed to decrypt your hard drive if BitLocker or FileVault locks your system. BitLocker may activate on your system if there is an unexpected power outage, if you are replacing hardware components in your computer, or if you unplug your computer and move it to a different location. In those scenarios, you will need the recovery key to decrypt your data. Please save your key somewhere safe (i.e., not on your computer). CIS recommends Google Drive, which is encrypted on Google’s servers, or any encrypted password manager, such as LastPass at HMC. Available to faculty, students, and staff at HMC. Configuration of these applications can vary from system to system, but at its simplest:
Bitlocker requirements:
Windows 10 or 11 (Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions) 
Trusted Platform Module (TPM) – special microchip in most newer Windows computers
FileVault requirements:
Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) or higher
The CIS Help Desk can assist all users with turning on hard drive encryption.
You can find Instructions on how to do this yourself on Microsoft’s and Apple’s websites:
